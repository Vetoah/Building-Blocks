The bulk of the project is basically a deep dive into the financial markets, where I learn about what kind of analysis can be done with different forms of information (market data, news, tweets, etc.). The goal is to create enough building blocks for a reasonable strategy to emerge.

The market data is coming from the Phemex crypto exchange. Here is there [API](https://github.com/phemex/phemex-api-docs/blob/master/Public-Contract-API-en.md).
